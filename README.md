# Automated Price Drop Notification for Kindle Fire

## Project Overview

This application monitors the price of the Kindle Fire on Amazon.com and sends an automated notification whenever there's a price drop. The notification method can be chosen from available options, such as email, SMS, or web notification. The price monitoring runs periodically, and you can configure the threshold for price drop notifications.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: The application scrapes the price of Kindle Fire from Amazon.com.
- **Price Comparison**: Compares the latest price with the previously recorded price to detect price drops.
- **Notification**: Sends notifications (email, SMS, or web) when a price drop is detected.
- **Logging**: Logs all price checks and notifications sent.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Set the price drop threshold and notification method via API endpoints.

### Challenges Faced and Solutions
1. Web Scraping Limitations
 Problem: Amazon's dynamic structure and bot detection made scraping difficult.
 Solution: Used Jsoup for scraping, identify the price UI element and adjusted user-agent headers to mimic a browser request.
2. Database Management
 Problem: Storing and retrieving prices efficiently.
 Solution: Implemented indexing on productName and used findTopByProductNameOrderByCheckedAtDesc to fetch the latest price.
3. Testing and Debugging
 Problem: Ensuring that price drop detection works correctly.
 Solution: Wrote unit tests for PriceTrackerService.
### Additional Features Implemented
 Configurable Notification Settings: Users can set thresholds for price drop alerts.
 Scheduled Price Checks: Uses @Scheduled annotation to automate price tracking.
 Logging Mechanism: Records every price check and notification event.
### Future Enhancements
 Graphical Price History Visualization
 Enhance configurations for notification systems example: SMS, AWS Topic etc
 Multiple Product Tracking â€“ currently tracks 1 hardcoded product
